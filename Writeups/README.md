# 🛡️ Security Analysis & Lab Write-ups

This directory serves as a technical library documenting my hands-on cybersecurity investigations.  
It reflects my end-to-end methodology in **threat detection, digital forensics, and incident response**
across SOC and Blue Team environments.

---

## 📑 Content Overview

- **SOC & SIEM Operations:**  
  Real-world alert triaging and investigation using **Microsoft Sentinel** and **Splunk**.

- **Digital Forensics:**  
  Host-based forensic analysis focusing on Windows Registry artifacts and persistence mechanisms.

- **Network Analysis:**  
  Investigation of malicious traffic, C2 beaconing, and PCAP-based threat detection.

- **Advent of Cyber (2025):**  
  Advanced labs simulating modern attack techniques and defensive analysis.

## 🛠️ My Analysis Methodology

All investigations follow a structured approach aligned with the  
**NIST Incident Response Framework**:

1. **Preparation & Scope**  
   Defining investigation boundaries, assets, and attack surface.

2. **Evidence Collection**  
   Collecting network, host, and SIEM logs using industry tools  
   (Wireshark, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Registry Explorer).

3. **Technical Correlation**  
   Correlating logs and artifacts to reconstruct the full attack timeline.

4. **Remediation & Mapping**  
   Providing actionable mitigation steps and mapping findings to **MITRE ATT&CK**.
